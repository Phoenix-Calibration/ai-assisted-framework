# AIris Validation Findings 👁️

**Project:** Phoenix IRIS  
**Validation Period:** 2026-01-16 onwards  
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

---

## 📋 Purpose

This document captures insights, discoveries, and learnings as we validate the AIris framework using the real Phoenix IRIS project.

**Update Frequency:** After each validation phase or whenever significant insights emerge.

---

## 🎯 Key Questions We're Answering

1. **Does constraint-first methodology work?**
   - Does AI respect technical constraints when design.md is read first?
   - Measurable difference in AI suggestions with/without design.md?

2. **Are AIris templates practical?**
   - Do they capture real project complexity?
   - Time estimates accurate?
   - Overhead justified by value?

3. **Does session workflow maintain context?**
   - Can we resume from handoff.md effectively?
   - Context loss across sessions minimized?

4. **How does AIris compare to current docs?**
   - AIris-generated docs vs existing Phoenix IRIS docs
   - Gaps identified? Improvements made?

## 📊 Phase 0: Setup & Planning (2026-01-16)

### ✅ What Worked Well

**Clear Structure from Start**
- Having validation-plan.md provides roadmap
- Tracker makes progress visible
- Separation of framework repo vs project repo is clean

**Step-by-Step Approach**
- Breaking validation into discrete phases prevents overwhelm
- Each phase has clear checkpoints
- Can adjust framework between phases if needed

**Fresh Start Strategy**
- Treating existing project as "new" enables fair comparison
- Can test if AIris would lead to different/better decisions
- Real project complexity tests templates properly

### 🤔 Open Questions

**Repository Strategy**
- Will having docs in project repo (phoenix-iris) vs framework repo feel natural?
- How do we link templates from framework to project?

**Time Investment**
- Is 30-45 hours reasonable for validation?
- What if phases take 2-3x longer than estimated?

**Team Involvement**
- Should we involve Phoenix team earlier or wait until docs complete?
- How to get feedback without disrupting their work?

### 💡 Insights

**Validation Design**
- Having explicit "CRITICAL" phase (Design + constraint-first test) is smart
- Metrics defined upfront will prevent subjective assessment
- Comparing AIris docs to existing docs is the key validation

**Documentation Approach**
- Three docs (plan + tracker + findings) cover all bases
- Plan = roadmap, Tracker = progress, Findings = learnings
- This structure could be template for future validations
