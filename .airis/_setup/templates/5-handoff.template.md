# Handoff Template - Session State Transfer

> **Purpose:** Transfer verified results and context from one session to the next.  
> **Updated:** After EVERY session (mandatory)  
> **Created By:** AI at the end of each session  
> **Replaces:** Previous handoff content (does not accumulate)  
> **Analogy:** Like a Git commit message + diff — captures what changed and why

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This Document's Role

Think of the document hierarchy like Git:
- **Tracker.md** = Git repository (all commits, full history)
- **ToDo.md** = Working branch (current changes in progress)
- **Handoff.md** = Commit message + diff (what changed and why)

**Handoff.md is the SESSION MEMORY:**
- AI models have no memory between sessions
- This document provides continuity
- AI reads this at the start of the next session to understand project state
- Must be concise but complete

**Update Strategy:**
- **REPLACE** entire content after each session (don't accumulate)
- Keep only current state, not history (history lives in Git and Tracker.md)
- Focus on what's important for the NEXT session

---

## 📋 8-SECTION CANONICAL SCHEMA

1. Context Snapshot
2. Active Task(s)
3. Decisions Made
4. Changes Since Last Session
5. Validation & Evidence
6. Risks & Unknowns
7. Next Steps
8. Status Summary

## Complete Example: Full Handoff

```markdown
# Handoff - Session State Transfer

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-15 14:30
**Session Number:** #003
**Developer:** Alice

---

## 1. Context Snapshot

- Payment API project started (Week 2 of development)
- Project scaffolding (T-001) complete and verified ✅
- CI pipeline established and passing (GitHub Actions)
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across codebase
- Database schema designed and migrated (T-002) ✅
- Ready to implement authentication layer (T-003)

---

## 2. Active Task(s)

**Completed This Session:**
- T-002 ✅ — Database schema for payments (PostgreSQL migrations)

**Next Up:**
- T-003 ⚪ — Implement JWT authentication endpoints

**In Progress:**
- None

---

## 3. Decisions Made

**Decision 1:** Use UUID for primary keys instead of auto-increment integers
- **Rationale:** Better for distributed systems, prevents ID collision in microservices
- **References:** Documented as ADR-002 in Design.md §11
- **Impact:** All entity tables use UUID v4

**Decision 2:** Separate schema for audit logs
- **Rationale:** Easier to manage data retention policies and optimize query performance
- **References:** Design.md §3.3 database architecture
- **Impact:** Created `audit` schema alongside `public` schema

**Decision 3:** Use pg-migrate for database versioning
- **Rationale:** Team familiarity, good rollback support, works with TypeScript
- **References:** Design.md §4.3 development workflow

---

## Instructions for AI

When creating/updating handoff.md at the end of a session:

### Reading Context First

Before writing the handoff, read in this order:
1. **Design.md** — Technical constraints and ADRs
2. **Scope.md** — Project goals, boundaries, and features (§4)
3. **Tracker.md** — Task status and history
5. **Current ToDo.md** — What was planned for this session
6. **Previous Handoff.md** — Last session's state

### Writing the Handoff

**Section 1 (Context Snapshot):**
- 3-5 bullets maximum
- Focus on CURRENT state, not history
- Mention major completed milestones
- State what's ready for next work

**Section 2 (Active Tasks):**
- List tasks completed THIS SESSION
- Clearly mark next task to work on
- Include partial progress if applicable
- Use task IDs from Tracker.md (e.g., T-003)

**Section 3 (Decisions Made):**
- Only decisions from THIS SESSION
- Always include rationale
- Reference ADRs if created in Design.md
- Explain impact on future work

**Section 4 (Changes):**
- List actual file changes with line counts
- Group by created/modified/deleted
- Brief description of what changed
- Include dependency changes

**Section 5 (Validation):**
- Actual proof, not claims
- Include links to test runs, CI pipelines
- Exact numbers (X/Y tests passing)
- Code review status if applicable

**Section 6 (Risks & Unknowns):**
- Be honest about uncertainties
- Flag potential problems early
- Suggest mitigation strategies
- Note technical debt created

**Section 7 (Next Steps):**
- Separate immediate human actions from next session work
- Be specific and actionable
- Reference relevant task IDs
- Include follow-up items

**Section 8 (Status Summary):**
- Clear status indicator (✅/⚠️/🚫)
- Percentage completion with context
- Session efficiency metrics
- Velocity for planning purposes

## Multi-Developer Considerations

### Per-Developer Handoff Structure

When multiple developers work on the same project:

```
.ai-framework/session/
├── alice/
│   └── current/
│       └── handoff.md (Alice's personal context)
├── bob/
│   └── current/
│       └── handoff.md (Bob's personal context)
└── shared/
    └── project-status.md (Consolidated team view)
```

**Each developer's handoff contains:**
- Personal context (what THEY worked on)
- Tasks THEY completed
- Decisions THEY made
- Files THEY changed

**Shared project-status.md contains:**
- Overall project health
- All completed tasks across team
- Cross-team dependencies
- Next milestones

### Reading Context as a Developer

At the start of a session, AI reads:
1. **strategy/** documents (shared, stable)
2. **tactics/tracker.md** (shared, latest from main branch)
3. **session/{your-name}/current/handoff.md** (your personal context)
4. **session/shared/project-status.md** (team context)

This gives AI both:
- Your specific context (where YOU left off)
- Team context (what OTHERS have done)

**Session Number:** #001

## 1. Context Snapshot
- New project started
- Repository initialized
- Basic scaffolding complete

## 2. Active Task(s)
**Completed This Session:**
- T-001 ✅ — Project scaffolding

**Next Up:**
- T-002 ⚪ — Database schema design

[... rest of handoff ...]
```

### After Session #002 (REPLACES Session #001)

```markdown
# Handoff - Session State Transfer

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-15 14:30
**Session Number:** #002

## 1. Context Snapshot
- Payment API project (Week 2)
- Scaffolding complete ✅
- Database schema designed ✅
- Ready for authentication

## 2. Active Task(s)
**Completed This Session:**
- T-002 ✅ — Database schema for payments

**Next Up:**
- T-003 ⚪ — JWT authentication

[... rest of handoff ...]
```

**Notice:**
- Session #001 content is GONE (not accumulated)
- Context Snapshot includes T-001 outcome but focuses on current state
- Active Tasks shows T-002 as just completed
- This is a FRESH snapshot for the next session

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Accumulating history** — Don't keep appending to previous handoffs
✅ Replace entire content each session

❌ **Too verbose** — Don't write essays in Context Snapshot
✅ Keep it to 3-5 bullets

❌ **Missing rationale** — Don't just list decisions
✅ Always explain WHY each decision was made

❌ **Vague validation** — Don't say "tests passed"
✅ Say "Unit tests: 45/45 passing, Coverage: 87%"

❌ **No evidence** — Don't claim without proof
✅ Include links to CI runs, test reports

❌ **Generic next steps** — Don't say "continue development"
✅ Say "T-004: Implement payment webhook handler"

❌ **Forgetting metrics** — Don't skip efficiency tracking
✅ Always include planned vs actual time
