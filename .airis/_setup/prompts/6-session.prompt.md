# Session Prompt

## Purpose
Manage complete session lifecycle: 
- Create ToDo Phase 1 (simple task list)
- Start Session (Opening Brief with progressive context loading - Phase 2)
- Close Session (Closing Report + Handoff + **Propose** Tracker updates - Phase 3)

**CRITICAL:** This prompt does NOT apply tracker updates. It only proposes them. User invokes 5-tracker.prompt.md to apply changes.

## Context Detection
Detect which moment of the session:

**IF user says:** "Create ToDo for T-XXX, T-YYY" OR provides task list
→ Generate ToDo.md Phase 1 (simple task list only)

**IF user provides:** ToDo.md Phase 1 OR "Start session"
→ Read context stack progressively → Generate Opening Brief (Phase 2)

**IF user says:** "Session complete" OR "Generate Closing Report"
→ Generate Closing Report + Update Handoff + **Propose** Tracker updates (Phase 3)

---

## PART 0: CREATE TODO (Phase 1 - Simple File Creation)

### Purpose
Generate the initial ToDo.md file with just the task list. NO context reading yet.

### User Input Options

**Option A: User specifies tasks**
```
User: "Create ToDo for T-003 and T-004"
User: "I want to work on T-003: Design database schema and T-004: Implement authentication"
```

**Option B: User asks for recommendations**
```
User: "What should I work on today?"
User: "Help me plan my session"
```

### Process

**IF user specified tasks (Option A):**
1. Extract task IDs mentioned
2. Generate simple ToDo.md Phase 1

**IF user asks for recommendations (Option B):**
1. Quick read ONLY:
   - Handoff.md §7 "Next Steps" (if exists)
   - Tracker.md - scan for ⚪ Ready tasks with high priority
2. Suggest 1-2 tasks
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Generate ToDo.md Phase 1

### Output: ToDo.md Phase 1

Generate this simple structure:

```markdown
# Session ToDo (YYYY-MM-DD, [time budget])

- T-XXX: [Task title]
- T-YYY: [Task title] (if time permits)
```

**That's it. No Opening Brief yet. No context stack reading yet.**

### Example Interaction

**User:** "Create ToDo for T-003 and T-004, 2 hour session"

**AI:** 
```
Created ToDo.md:

# Session ToDo (2026-01-15, 2-hour time budget)

- T-003: Design database schema
- T-004: Implement authentication (if time permits)

Ready to start session? Say "Start session" when ready.
```

---

## PART 1: SESSION START (Opening Brief - Phase 2)

### Purpose
Read context using PROGRESSIVE LOADING strategy and generate Opening Brief

### Trigger
User says: "Start session" OR provides existing ToDo.md Phase 1

### Step 1: Read Context Stack (Progressive Loading)

**Read in stages based on need:**

**STAGE 1 - ALWAYS READ (Mandatory):**

1. **Handoff.md** (FIRST - immediate context)
   - Read complete document
   - Understand current project state
   
2. **Design.md** (SECOND - constraints are non-negotiable)
   - Read complete document
   - All sections

**STAGE 2 - SELECTIVE READ (As Needed):**

3. **Requirements.md** (THIRD - features relevant to session tasks)
   - Read ONLY sections related to tasks in ToDo
   - Skip unrelated features
   
4. **Tracker.md** (FOURTH - session tasks + dependencies)
   - Read ONLY tasks mentioned in ToDo
   - Read their dependencies
   - Skip completed/unrelated tasks

**STAGE 3 - REFERENCE (If Clarification Needed):**

5. **Scope.md** (FIFTH - only if boundary questions arise)
   - Read only if needed for clarification
   - Not typically required for implementation

**Token Efficiency:**
- Full read (all docs complete): ~17,500 tokens (rare)
- Typical read (Stage 1 + selective Stage 2): ~5,000 tokens (most sessions)
- Minimum read (Stage 1 only): ~2,500 tokens (simple tasks)

**Why progressive?** Respects context window limits while maintaining constraint-first principle.

### Step 2: Generate Opening Brief

Add this section to ToDo.md:

```markdown
---

## Opening Brief

**Context:** [3-5 sentences from Handoff describing current state]

**Active Task:** [First task from ToDo] — [Title from Tracker]

**Plan:**
1. [Step from Tracker acceptance criteria]
2. [Step referencing Design.md §X.Y]
3. [Step referencing Requirements.md §Z]
4. [Validation step]
5. [Review step]

**Success Criteria:** [From Tracker.md]
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

**Time Estimate:** [Based on Tracker]

**References:**
- Design.md §X.Y - [Relevant section]
- Requirements.md §Z - [Relevant section]
- Tracker.md T-XXX - [Full criteria]
```

### Step 3: Validation
- [ ] Read context using progressive loading
- [ ] Always read Handoff + Design (Stage 1)
- [ ] Selectively read Requirements + Tracker (Stage 2)
- [ ] Opening Brief references specific sections
- [ ] Plan is concrete and actionable

---

## PART 2: SESSION CLOSE (Closing Report + Handoff + Propose Tracker - Phase 3)

### Purpose
Generate session artifacts and **PROPOSE** Tracker updates (NOT apply them)

### Trigger
User says: "Session complete" OR "Generate Closing Report" OR "End session"

### Step 1: Generate Closing Report

Add to ToDo.md:

```markdown
---

## Closing Report

**What Changed:**
- `path/to/file.ext` created/modified (+X lines)
- `path/to/file2.ext` created/modified (+Y lines)

**Validation & Evidence:**
- Tests: [Pass/Fail status, coverage percentage]
- Documentation: [What was updated]
- CI: [Build status, links]
- Peer Review: [Who reviewed, outcome]

**Status:** [Percentage complete] — [Task status update]

**Task Updates:**
- T-XXX: [Old status] → [New status] ([Brief reason])

**Decisions Made:**
- [Decision 1] - [Rationale] (ADR-XXX if applicable)
- [Decision 2] - [Rationale]

**Blockers Encountered:**
- [Blocker description] OR None

**Next Steps:**
1. Human: [Immediate actions for human including tracker update]
2. Next session: [Recommended task for next session]
3. Follow-up: [Any longer-term considerations]

**Session Metrics:**
- Planned: [X tasks, Y hours]
- Completed: [X tasks, Y hours actual]
- Efficiency: [Percentage]
```

### Step 2: Update Handoff.md

Generate/replace complete Handoff.md with 8 sections:

```markdown
# Handoff - Session State Transfer

**Last Updated:** [Date Time]
**Session Number:** #[Number]

## 1. Context Snapshot
[3-5 bullets - current project state]

## 2. Active Task(s)
**Completed This Session:**
- [Tasks completed]

**Next Up:**
- [Next recommended task]

## 3. Decisions Made
[Decisions from this session with rationale]

## 4. Changes Since Last Session
[Files created/modified/deleted]

## 5. Validation & Evidence
[Test results, CI links, proof of completion]

## 6. Risks & Unknowns
[Identified risks or unknowns]

## 7. Next Steps
**Immediate:**
[Human actions - including invoking tracker prompt]

**Next Session:**
[AI recommendations]

## 8. Status Summary
[Project status with metrics]
```

**Important:** 
- REPLACE entire Handoff.md content (don't accumulate)
- This is a fresh snapshot for next session
- Focus on current state, not history

### Step 3: PROPOSE Tracker Updates (DO NOT APPLY)

**CRITICAL:** You do NOT apply tracker updates. You only propose them.

Generate proposal section:

```markdown
---

## Proposed Tracker Updates

**To apply these updates, invoke 5-tracker.prompt.md:**

Command: "Update tracker: T-003 ⚪→✅, T-004 ⚪→🟡"

**Proposed Changes:**

**Tasks Completed:**
- T-XXX: [Task title]
  - Status: [Old] → [New]
  - Actual Effort: [Time] (estimated: [Original estimate])
  - Evidence: [Links and proof]
  - Completion Date: [If complete]
  - Notes: [Important notes]

**Tasks In Progress:**
- T-YYY: [Task title]
  - Status: ⚪ → 🟡
  - Progress: [Percentage]
  - Remaining: [Estimate]

**Dependencies Unblocked:**
- T-ZZZ: ⏸️ Blocked → ⚪ Ready to start
  - Reason: [What unblocked it]

**New Tasks Discovered:**
- T-AAA: [New task title]
  - Priority: [Level]
  - Estimate: [Time]
  - Dependencies: [If any]

**Project Metrics:**
- Tasks completed: +[Number]
- Progress: [Old]% → [New]%
- Velocity: [Calculate from recent sessions]

---

**Next:** Invoke 5-tracker.prompt.md to apply these updates to tracker.md
```

### Step 4: Remind User

After generating proposals:

```
✅ Closing Report generated
✅ Handoff.md updated
✅ Tracker updates proposed

To apply tracker updates, invoke:
"Update tracker: T-003 ⚪→✅, T-004 ⚪→🟡"
(Use 5-tracker.prompt.md)
```

**DO NOT** apply tracker updates yourself. User must explicitly invoke 5-tracker.prompt.md.

---

## Special Considerations

### For Existing Projects
- Opening Brief should consider both new features AND refactoring tasks
- Closing Report should note if task was feature vs architecture improvement
- Handoff should track migration phase progress

### For Multi-Session Tasks
- Opening Brief acknowledges partial completion
- Closing Report clearly states percentage complete
- Handoff maintains continuity of in-progress work

### Error Handling
- If strategy docs are incomplete: ask user to complete them first
- If Handoff.md missing (first session): create from scratch
- If Tracker.md outdated: recommend regenerating it with 5-tracker.prompt.md

---

## Complete Workflow Example

### Step 1: Create ToDo (Part 0)

**User:** "Create ToDo for T-003, 2 hours"

**AI:** 
```
# Session ToDo (2026-01-15, 2-hour time budget)

- T-003: Design database schema

Created. Say "Start session" when ready.
```

**No context reading yet. Just file creation.**

---

### Step 2: Start Session (Part 1)

**User:** "Start session"

**AI:** 
```
Reading context (progressive loading)...
✓ Handoff.md (Stage 1 - Always)
✓ Design.md (Stage 1 - Always)
✓ Requirements.md §3 (Stage 2 - Selective, T-003 related)
✓ Tracker.md T-003 (Stage 2 - Selective)

Adding Opening Brief...
```

**Progressive context read based on task needs.**

Output:
```markdown
# Session ToDo (2026-01-15, 2-hour time budget)

- T-003: Design database schema

---

## Opening Brief

**Context:** Foundation complete (T-001 ✅, T-002 ✅). Moving to data layer.

**Active Task:** T-003 — Design database schema

**Plan:**
1. Review entity relationships from Requirements.md §3.3
2. Create ERD with entities from Requirements.md §3.1
3. Define indexes per Design.md §8.2
4. Create migrations per Design.md §3.3
5. Peer review

**Success Criteria:**
- All entities in schema
- Foreign keys defined
- Indexes for performance
- Migrations tested

**Time Estimate:** 90 minutes

**References:**
- Design.md §3.3 - Database strategy
- Requirements.md §3 - Data entities
- Tracker.md T-003 - Full criteria

Ready to begin!
```

---

### Step 3: Work Happens...

[Collaboration between human and AI]

---

### Step 4: Close Session (Part 2)

**User:** "Session complete"

**AI:** 
```
[Generates Closing Report]
[Updates Handoff.md]
[Proposes Tracker updates]

✅ Done! 

To update tracker.md, invoke:
"Update tracker: T-003 ⚪→✅"
(Use 5-tracker.prompt.md)
```

**User then separately invokes:** "Update tracker: T-003 ⚪→✅"  
**(That calls 5-tracker.prompt.md, not this prompt)**

---

## Summary of Responsibilities

**Part 0 (Create ToDo):**
- ✅ Generate simple task list file
- ❌ NO full context read
- ❌ NO Opening Brief

**Part 1 (Start Session):**
- ✅ Progressive context loading (Stage 1 always, Stage 2 selective, Stage 3 if needed)
- ✅ Generate Opening Brief
- ✅ Add to existing ToDo.md

**Part 2 (Close Session):**
- ✅ Generate Closing Report
- ✅ Update Handoff.md (complete replacement)
- ✅ **PROPOSE** Tracker updates (with command for user)
- ❌ **DO NOT APPLY** tracker updates (that's 5-tracker.prompt.md's job)

---

## Validation Checklist

**Part 0 - Create ToDo:**
- [ ] Simple task list only
- [ ] No Opening Brief yet
- [ ] Date and time budget included
- [ ] Ready message to user

**Part 1 - Start Session:**
- [ ] Stage 1: Read Handoff + Design (always)
- [ ] Stage 2: Read Requirements + Tracker (selectively, task-related only)
- [ ] Stage 3: Read Scope (only if needed)
- [ ] Opening Brief added to ToDo
- [ ] References specific sections
- [ ] Plan is actionable

**Part 2 - Close Session:**
- [ ] Closing Report complete
- [ ] Handoff updated (8 sections, replaced not accumulated)
- [ ] Tracker proposal with clear command
- [ ] Reminder to use 5-tracker.prompt.md
- [ ] Did NOT apply tracker updates

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Progressive Loading:** Read Handoff + Design always, others selectively
2. **Single Responsibility:** Session prompt handles sessions, tracker prompt handles tracker.md
3. **Propose Only:** Never apply tracker updates, only propose with command
4. **User Control:** User explicitly invokes 5-tracker.prompt.md to apply
5. **Handoff Replacement:** Always replace, never accumulate
