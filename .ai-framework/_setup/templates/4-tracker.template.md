# Tracker Document Template

> **Purpose:** Global task registry containing all implementation tasks derived from strategy documents.  
> **Generated From:** Design.md + Scope.md + Requirements.md (AI reads all three)  
> **Updated:** Continuously as work progresses  
> **Owner:** AI-generated, human-maintained

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: How to Generate This Document

This document should be **generated by AI**, not filled manually.

**AI Prompt:**
```
Read Design.md, Scope.md, and Requirements.md completely.

Generate Tracker.md with ALL tasks needed to build this system according to:
- Technical architecture and constraints from Design.md
- Project boundaries and goals from Scope.md  
- Functional requirements and features from Requirements.md

Each task must have:
- Unique ID (T-001, T-002, etc.)
- Clear acceptance criteria
- References to source documents (e.g., "per Design.md §3.2")
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies

Order tasks logically based on dependencies and implementation sequence.
```

**Order of Reading for AI:**
1. **Design.md FIRST** - Understand technical constraints
2. **Scope.md SECOND** - Understand project goals and boundaries
3. **Requirements.md THIRD** - Understand features and user stories
4. **Generate tasks** that satisfy all three documents

## NEXT STEPS

Once Tracker.md is generated and maintained:

1. **Generate ToDo.md for each work session**
   - Select subset of tasks from Tracker
   - Focus on 2-4 tasks per session
   - AI will add Opening Brief and Closing Report

2. **Update Tracker after each session**
   - Mark completed tasks as ✅ Complete
   - Add evidence of completion
   - Update progress metrics
   - Identify blockers

3. **Review progress regularly**
   - Weekly review of completed vs. planned tasks
   - Adjust estimates based on actual effort
   - Re-prioritize tasks if needed
   - Update dependencies if project scope changes

4. **Generate Handoff.md when needed**
   - When developer changes
   - When taking break from project
   - For knowledge transfer
   - For project documentation
