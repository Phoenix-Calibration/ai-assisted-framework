# AI-Assisted Development Framework

Framework for maintaining architectural coherence across AI-assisted development sessions through document-driven structure and constraint-first methodology.

---

## What is This?

A structured approach to AI-assisted development that prevents common pitfalls like architectural drift, scope creep, and inconsistent technical decisions across sessions. The framework uses a hierarchy of documents that serve as persistent context for stateless AI models.

**Key Innovation:** Separates what humans decide (architecture, boundaries) from what AI generates (tasks, implementation plans), ensuring technical constraints guide solutions rather than AI suggesting the "path of least resistance."

## Document Hierarchy

### Phase 1: Strategic Foundation (Human-Created, Stable)

**Created in this order:**

1. **scope.md** (~8 pages, 4-6 hours)
   - Project vision and goals
   - Success metrics and SLOs
   - In-scope / out-of-scope boundaries
   - Stakeholders and constraints
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/1-scope.template.md`
   - **AI Helper:** `_setup/prompts/2-scope.prompt.md`

2. **requirements.md** (~30 pages, 6-10 hours)
   - Functional requirements by feature
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Business rules and validation logic
   - Data entities and relationships
   - Integration requirements
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/2-requirements.template.md`
   - **AI Helper:** `_setup/prompts/3-requirements.prompt.md`

3. **design.md** (~15 pages, 6-10 hours)
   - Architecture patterns and layers
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Development standards and conventions
   - Security and performance guidelines
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/3-design.template.md`
   - **AI Helper:** `_setup/prompts/4-design.prompt.md`

**Why this order?**
- Scope first: Define boundaries before details
- Requirements second: Know WHAT before deciding HOW
- Design third: Architectural decisions informed by actual requirements

### Phase 2: Tactical Roadmap (AI-Generated, Evolving)

4. **tracker.md** (AI-generated from all strategy docs)
   - Complete task breakdown (T-001, T-002, etc.)
   - Task dependencies and priorities
   - Status tracking (⚪ ⏸️ 🟡 ✅ 🚫)
   - Progress metrics and velocity
   - Updated after each session
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/4-tracker.template.md`
   - **AI Prompt:** `_setup/prompts/5-tracker.prompt.md`

### Phase 3: Session Execution (Context-Sized, Per-Session)

5. **todo.md** (Subset of tracker, per developer)
   - 1-3 tasks for current session
   - Opening Brief (context + plan)
   - Closing Report (what changed)
   - Session duration: 1-6 hours
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/5-todo.template.md`
   - **AI Prompt:** `_setup/prompts/6-session.prompt.md`

6. **handoff.md** (Session state transfer, per developer)
   - Current project snapshot
   - Decisions made this session
   - Next recommended steps
   - Replaces completely each session (not accumulated)
   - **Template:** `_setup/templates/6-handoff.template.md`
   - **Generated by:** `_setup/prompts/6-session.prompt.md` (Part 2)

## Framework Phases & Prompts

### Phase 1: Construction of Strategic Documents (4 prompts)

**Purpose:** Create the foundation documents that define project vision, requirements, and architecture.

| Prompt | Input | Output | Time |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| `1-discovery.prompt.md` | Business idea, PRD, or existing codebase | PRD document | 2-4h |
| `2-scope.prompt.md` | PRD or business context | scope.md | 4-6h |
| `3-requirements.prompt.md` | scope.md + PRD | requirements.md | 6-10h |
| `4-design.prompt.md` | requirements.md + scope.md | design.md | 6-10h |

**Adaptability:**
- **New projects:** Generate from scratch with AI assistance
- **Existing projects:** Document AS-IS state, then create TO-BE evolution plan

### Phase 2: Tactical Generation (1 prompt)

**Purpose:** Convert strategic documents into actionable implementation tasks.

| Prompt | Input | Output | Time |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| `5-tracker.prompt.md` | design.md + scope.md + requirements.md | tracker.md | 1-2h |

**Features:**
- Generates complete task breakdown
- Calculates dependencies automatically
- Adapts to project type (new vs existing)
- Updates after each session

### Phase 3: Session Execution (1 prompt, 3 parts)

**Purpose:** Manage complete session lifecycle from planning to closure.

| Part | Trigger | Action | Output |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Part 0 | "Create ToDo for T-XXX" | Generate simple task list | todo.md Phase 1 |
| Part 1 | "Start session" | Read full context, create plan | Opening Brief in todo.md |
| Part 2 | "Session complete" | Generate reports, update state | Closing Report + handoff.md + Tracker updates |

**Single unified prompt:** `6-session.prompt.md` handles all three moments.

## The Constraint-First Principle

### The Problem: AI Bias Toward Generic Solutions

When AI reads requirements before understanding technical constraints, it suggests the "path of least resistance" - usually generic, cloud-based solutions that may violate your architectural decisions.

**Example:**
```
❌ Wrong Order:
   AI reads: "Need real-time chat feature" (from requirements)
   AI suggests: "Use Firebase" (easiest solution)
   Your architecture: FastAPI + PostgreSQL (conflict!)

✅ Right Order:
   AI reads: "Must use FastAPI + PostgreSQL" (from design)
   Then reads: "Need real-time chat feature" (from requirements)
   AI suggests: "Server-Sent Events in FastAPI" (respects constraints)
```

### Two Different Orders

**1. Document CREATION Order (Logical for Humans):**
```
PRD → Scope → Requirements → Design
```
**Rationale:** You cannot decide HOW to build (Design) without knowing WHAT to build (Requirements).

**2. Document PRESENTATION Order (For AI Code Generation):**
```
Design → Scope → Requirements
```
**Rationale:** AI gives more weight to information it reads first. Technical constraints must be non-negotiable.

### How It Works in Practice

When using AI to generate code or implementation plans:

```markdown
"Read these documents in this order:

1. design.md (FIRST - these constraints are non-negotiable)
2. scope.md (SECOND - project boundaries)  
3. requirements.md (THIRD - features to implement)

The technical decisions in design.md override everything else.
Now generate the implementation for [feature]."
```

This is documented in:
- `design.md` template (CRITICAL section at the top)
- All generation prompts (explicit instructions)
- Session prompt Part 1 (reading order enforced)

## Getting Started

### For NEW Projects (From Scratch)

**Step 1: Optional - Create PRD (if you don't have one)**
```bash
# Use discovery prompt to structure your idea
# Load: _setup/prompts/1-discovery.prompt.md
# Claude will guide you through creating PRD
```

**Step 2: Create Strategic Documents (IN ORDER)**
```bash
# 2.1 Create scope.md
# Template: _setup/templates/1-scope.template.md
# Or use: _setup/prompts/2-scope.prompt.md with your PRD

# 2.2 Create requirements.md  
# Template: _setup/templates/2-requirements.template.md
# Or use: _setup/prompts/3-requirements.prompt.md with scope.md

# 2.3 Create design.md
# Template: _setup/templates/3-design.template.md
# Or use: _setup/prompts/4-design.prompt.md with requirements.md
```

**Step 3: Generate Tracker**
```bash
# Use: _setup/prompts/5-tracker.prompt.md
# Input: design.md + scope.md + requirements.md
# Output: Complete task breakdown in tracker.md
```

**Step 4: Start First Session**
```bash
# Create your developer folder
mkdir -p session/{your-name}/current
mkdir -p session/{your-name}/archive

# Use: _setup/prompts/6-session.prompt.md
# Part 0: "Create ToDo for T-001, T-002" → generates todo.md
# Part 1: "Start session" → adds Opening Brief
# [Work happens...]
# Part 2: "Session complete" → generates Closing Report + handoff.md
```

### For EXISTING Projects (Adopting Framework)

**Step 1: Document Current State**

Order is flexible since the system already exists:

```bash
# 1.1 Document current architecture
# Create: docs/design.md (AS-IS state)
# Include: Current tech stack, patterns, technical debt analysis

# 1.2 Document current project goals  
# Create: docs/scope.md
# Include: Current vision, boundaries, success metrics

# 1.3 Document existing features
# Create: docs/requirements.md
# Include: What system does today, known requirements for new work
```

**Step 2: Generate Tracker for Remaining Work**
```bash
# Use: _setup/prompts/5-tracker.prompt.md
# Will generate:
# - Feature Development tasks (new functionality)
# - Architecture Improvement tasks (refactoring)
# - Technical Debt tasks (fixes)
# - Migration tasks (if proposing architecture changes)
```

**Step 3: Create Initial Handoff**
```bash
# Manually create: session/{your-name}/current/handoff.md
# Capture: Current project state, recent work, next steps
```

**Step 4: Continue with Session-Based Development**

Same as new projects - use session prompt for all future work.

## Multi-Developer Workflow

### Workspace Organization

Each developer maintains independent workspace:

```
session/
├── alice/
│   ├── current/
│   │   ├── todo.md      # Alice's active session
│   │   └── handoff.md   # Alice's context
│   └── archive/         # Alice's completed sessions
├── bob/  
│   ├── current/
│   │   ├── todo.md      # Bob's active session
│   │   └── handoff.md   # Bob's context
│   └── archive/         # Bob's completed sessions
└── shared/
    └── project-status.md  # Team coordination
```

### Session Workflow Per Developer

**1. Session Start (Part 0 & 1)**
```bash
# Alice starts her session
# Reads: docs/ (shared) + tracker.md (shared) + session/alice/handoff.md (personal)
# Creates: session/alice/current/todo.md with Opening Brief
```

**2. Work (Parallel)**
```bash
# Alice works on T-005, T-006 (feature branch: feature/alice-auth)
# Bob works on T-012, T-013 (feature branch: feature/bob-payments)
# Both propose tracker updates in their branches
```

**3. Session Close (Part 2)**
```bash
# Alice completes session
# Generates: Closing Report in todo.md
# Updates: session/alice/current/handoff.md
# Proposes: tracker.md updates (in her branch)
# Archives: Moves todo.md to session/alice/archive/session-005_2026-01-15.md
```

**4. Merge to Main**
```bash
# Alice merges feature branch
# Tracker conflicts expected (different tasks updated)
# Resolution: Keep both updates (merge, don't overwrite)
# Update: shared/project-status.md with consolidated state
```

### Tracker Update Strategy

**During Development (On Feature Branch):**
- AI proposes tracker updates in Closing Report
- Developer approves → AI updates tracker.md in feature branch
- Changes stay isolated until merge

**At Merge Time:**
- Merge conflicts in tracker.md are NORMAL
- Resolution: Keep both updates (Alice's + Bob's tasks)
- Different developers work on different tasks
- Update shared/project-status.md

**Reading Context:**
Each developer reads:
1. `docs/` (shared strategy - stable)
2. `docs/tracker.md` (shared tasks - latest from main)
3. `session/{developer}/handoff.md` (personal context)
4. `session/shared/project-status.md` (team status)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns by Time Horizon

- **Strategy** (months) - Stable, human-owned (Scope, Requirements, Design)
- **Tactics** (weeks) - Evolving, AI-generated (Tracker)
- **Execution** (hours) - Bounded by context window (ToDo)
- **Transfer** (each session) - Verified state only (Handoff)

### 2. Stateless AI, Stateful Documents

- AI models have no memory between sessions
- Documents provide persistent context
- Each session reads full context stack
- Handoff captures verified state only

### 3. Constraint-First Methodology

- Design.md establishes technical non-negotiables
- AI reads constraints BEFORE requirements
- Prevents generic "path of least resistance" solutions
- Ensures architectural coherence

### 4. Continuous Verification

- Every session ends with validation
- Only verified work moves to handoff
- Quality gates enforced at each step
- Evidence required (tests, CI, reviews)

### 5. Document Order Matters

**Creation Order (Human Logic):**
- Scope → Requirements → Design
- Cannot decide HOW without knowing WHAT

**Presentation Order (AI Context):**
- Design → Scope → Requirements
- Technical constraints guide solution space

---

## Benefits

- ✅ **Architectural Coherence** - Technical constraints enforced across all AI sessions
- ✅ **Scope Control** - Clear boundaries prevent feature creep
- ✅ **Auditable Trail** - ADRs document why decisions were made
- ✅ **Consistent Patterns** - Security, quality, and performance standards applied uniformly
- ✅ **Fast Onboarding** - New team members read strategy docs to understand project
- ✅ **AI-Agnostic** - Works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or any LLM
- ✅ **Scalable** - Supports multiple developers working in parallel
- ✅ **Adaptable** - Works for new projects and existing codebases
- ✅ **Context-Efficient** - Session docs stay within LLM context windows

## Source & Evolution

### Original Framework

Based on: [From Fast Code to Reliable Software: A Framework for AI-Assisted Development](https://dev.to/stanislav_komarovsky_b478/from-fast-code-to-reliable-software-a-framework-for-ai-assisted-development-2dle) by Stanislav Komarovsky

**Original Equation:**
```
Design.md + Scope.md → Tracker.md → Code
```

### Key Enhancements by Phoenix Calibration

#### 1. Requirements.md as Separate Strategy Document

**Problem with original approach:**
- Scope.md mixing boundaries with detailed requirements
- Document size bloat (40+ pages)
- Update frequency mismatch (boundaries rarely change, requirements evolve)
- Context inefficiency for AI

**Our solution:**
- **scope.md** (~8 pages): Vision, boundaries, metrics, constraints
- **requirements.md** (~30 pages): User stories, business rules, data entities, UI/UX
- Proper separation of strategic boundaries vs operational specifications

**Updated equation:**
```
Design.md + Scope.md + Requirements.md → Tracker.md → Code
```

#### 2. Constraint-First Principle

**Problem:** AI suggests generic solutions when reading requirements before design.

**Our solution:** Document TWO orders:
- Creation order: Scope → Requirements → Design (human logic)
- Presentation order: Design → Scope → Requirements (AI context)

Documented in templates and prompts to ensure consistent application.

#### 3. Consolidated Prompts

**Evolution:** Reduced from 13+ prompts to 6 adaptive prompts
- Phase 1: 4 prompts (discovery, scope, requirements, design)
- Phase 2: 1 prompt (tracker)
- Phase 3: 1 unified prompt (session with 3 parts)

Each prompt adapts to:
- New vs existing projects
- Different project types
- Team size and workflow

#### 4. Multi-Developer Support

**Addition:** Per-developer workspaces with parallel development
- Independent todo.md and handoff.md per developer
- Shared project-status.md for coordination
- Tracker merge conflict strategy
- Session archiving per developer

#### 5. Unified Session Prompt

**Innovation:** Single prompt manages entire session lifecycle
- Part 0: Create ToDo (lightweight task selection)
- Part 1: Start Session (full context read + Opening Brief)
- Part 2: Close Session (Closing Report + Handoff + Tracker updates)

Eliminates need for separate prompts for each session moment.

### Other Enhancements

- PRD template for projects without formal requirements
- Session archiving strategy
- Business rules as explicit requirement category
- Data entities from functional perspective
- Integration requirements section
- Existing project support with AS-IS + TO-BE documentation
